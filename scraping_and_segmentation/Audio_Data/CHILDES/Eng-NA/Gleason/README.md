- There are three categories of data (Dinner, Father, Mother)
- Each categories contain conversations with each child (each folder with child's name)
- Original dataset is one file (`audio.mp4`) but was segemented into file per sentence using the timestamp in the transcription
- The segemented audio is saved inside `mp4_original` and `wav` (two are basically same but with different format)
- Some folders inside `Dinner` have audios but no segmentation (frank, patricia, susan, theresa, victor, wanda, william, xavia)
